A simple web quiz app that help students create & share their own quiz reviewer.

### Short History

When I was grade 10, one technique that our teacher do to make his students not fail the exam on his subject is to ask questions everyday about the previous topic, and guess what, no one failed in the class. For me it's a very effective because the lessons on the students mind will always get refreshed.

I learned coding when I was senior high & until then I learned web technologies So I think It's a good idea to create a simple web app so that I can share this technique to my friends/classmates. It's my last year on college so this is my last personal project for my schoolmates. 

Hope it helps them :kissing_heart:
